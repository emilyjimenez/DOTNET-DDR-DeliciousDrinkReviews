## Description

_MVC Web about for a drink review site._

## Notes for Epicodus Staff on Requirements

1. I already have a portfolio so I built a .NET website for my domain, deliciousdrinkreviews.com. Still meet requirements with minor tweaking.
2. Profile picture on about page, not landing page. This is a personal design choice.
3. Per discussion with teacher, ajax method does not have to relate to CRUD for posts or comments, just need to demonstrate basic understanding.



## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. _Clone [Delicious Drink Reviews](https://github.com/emilyjimenez/DOTNET-DDR-DeliciousDrinkReviews) from Github in the terminal of your choice._

2. _Navigate to the solution folder in your prefered terminal and run the commands `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and then `dotnet ef database update`._

3. _Now enter `dotnet run` into your terminal! After running dotnet run, the application should appear in your browser. To look at source code, open up the solution folder in your preferred text editor._
